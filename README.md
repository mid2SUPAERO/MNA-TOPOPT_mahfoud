# PIR_LiTianyi
the code, note and report of PIR 'Deep Learning pour la création de modèles réduits'

The 'Code' file contains the MATLAB code i used in the project. 

The 'Report' file contains the new result report that i made to my prof. 

The 'Bibliography_research' file contains the PPT and report about my biblio research. 

The 'PPT' file contains the PPT of presentation, sorry i haven't change the diagram. 

In the 'code' file, 'Read_dat.m' are used to read the '.dat' file from ABAQUS. But when i change the load combinations in ABAQUS,i am not succeed in writing the max stress and their position in to '.dat'. So i just write the result directly into my matlab code. But using 'Read_dat.m' can be much easier if there are results in '.dat' file.

Please run 'start up' first.

Sorry i am still writing the last part of my report and has not yet change the diagram.
